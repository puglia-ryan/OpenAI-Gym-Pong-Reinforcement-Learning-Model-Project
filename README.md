Pong_Reinforcement_Learning_Project
 The aim of this project was to create an machine learning model using reinforcement learning techniques which will able to play Pong in OpenAI Gym.
 The process of developing and evaluating this model are documented in the "6. Technical Deliverable" section of the report, "BSP2__Final_Report.pdf", provided.
 
 This report and project was created for one of my "Bachelor Semester Projects" at the University of Luxembourg. The Scientific Section of the report does not really have much to do with the code, but more to do with the actual subject matter which the code is based on. The technical part of the report covers the creation of the project in the repository. The design and production of the code and functionalities are documented, as well as a short analysis of the results. This project was my first dive into reinforcement learning from a programming perspective.
